Question (a)

```{r}
data <- read.csv("plastic-hardness.csv", header = TRUE)
model <- lm(Y ~ X,data = data)
plot(data$X, data$Y, main = "Regression Line", 
     xlab = "Elapsed Time in hours", ylab = "Hardness in Brinell units")
abline(model, col = "blue")
```

Yes, it is a good fit.

Question (b)

```{r}
predict(model, newdata = data.frame(X = 40))
```

Question (c)

```{r}
coef(model)[["X"]]
```

Question (d)

```{r}
residuals <- resid(model)
sum(residuals)
```

No, they don't sum to zero but the sum is very close to zero.

Question (e)

```{r}
sigma_squared <- sum(residuals^2) / (model$df.residual)
sigma <- sqrt(sigma_squared)
sigma_squared
sigma
```

$\limits$ is the standard deviation of the error terms. It should be the same unit as Y. So it is in Brinell units.
